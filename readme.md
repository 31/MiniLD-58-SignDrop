## Sign Drop

Sign drop is a MiniLD #58 entry about dropping off signs using a helicopter. It was created using Unity 5, personal edition. See [the entry page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/minild-58/?action=preview&uid=1712) for details.

Many thanks to CG Textures, where I got all the textures but the default Unity water.
